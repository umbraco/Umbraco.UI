              so errr, Say cheese, ahh awesome, what a wonderful day
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you very much for coming errr <br />
              welcome to the biggest Codegarden ever<br />
              without a doubt our biggest ever<br />
              the biggest err ever Codegarden<br />
              we are more than 380 people err today, <br />which is err about a
              little more than twenty times the people at the first
              Codegarden<br />
              err this year there is more than 700 people, <br />which makes it
              more than 30 times bigger than the very first one<br />
              err so awesome to be back at the err the err Umbraco festival
            </p>
            <p>
              Hey, before we start I just want to be the first one to use the
              'hi-five I suck' tag<br />
              the only thing that makes this very different from my normal
              Christmas Eve<br />
              is that I don't get sweaters like these from my inlaws which makes
              it even better...<br />
              so the book will be a little delayed, and that's my fault
            </p>
            <p>
              ahhh it's amazing to be back <br />
              umm I've really been looking forward to this<br />
              I love Codegarden is because we're all together<br />
              all the people you talk to on the forums, maillist people suddenly
              you see them in real life<br />
              this is fantastic<br />
              but we just have so much to share
            </p>
            <p>
              You should try to be up here<br />
              it's scary and awesome at the same time
            </p>
            <p>
              so let's err let's start<br />
              perhaps always people say<br />
              Doug has this weird thing on my machine, I can't see anything<br />
              aha he has notes, he's been preparing<br />
              which I have of course...
            </p>
            <p>
              You should try to be up here<br />
              I was here I think as the slide says quite a number of years
              ago<br />
              We have slides and we have demos and there is so much that can go
              wrong<br />
              err which is awesome
            </p>
            <p>
              So back in the day Per and I did demos and they failed<br />
              and then we were told you can't fail in a keynote<br />
              so then we made boring slideshow demos<br />
              and pre-recorded videos<br />
              and almost no dangerous demos <br />
              and we are so bored<br />
              we need stress<br />
              we need panic<br />
              we need to smell bad afterwards<br />
              and then Pete Duncanson isn't here<br />
              so we are going to have a buffet of Yellow Screens of Death
            </p>
            <p>You should try to be up here</p>
            <p>
              umm<br />
              those hats are still in use, err at the HQ you have to wear the
              hat
              <br />
              if you forgot to log out of the computer <br />
              and someone gets to post in Slack that you are giving out free
              beer,
              <br />
              you have to wear the hat.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am really excited that so many people have come here<br />
              it's pretty wild to just stand up here<br />
              one of the reasons I love Codegarden is because we're all
              together<br />
              all the people you talk to on the forums, maillist people<br />
              suddenly you see them in real life and for me, that's kinda like
              Christmas Eve
            </p>
            <p>
              just think about it for a second <br />
              people gathered here<br />
              all passionate about Umbraco<br />
              travelled across the world to share our ideas, our thoughts and
              maybe even umm... some code<br />
              I really think it's crazy
            </p>
            <p>
              you should try to be up here <br />
              it's the most awesome sight ever
            </p>
            <p>Are you ready?</p>
            <p>I don't know if you can see the slides now?</p>
            <p>
              Community and Infinity<br />
              Are you ready?<br />
              don't worry it's not as abstract as it sounds
            </p>
            <p>there is a long break after this one so err</p>
            <p>and now I have transitions</p>`}
